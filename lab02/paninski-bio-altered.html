       <br> <p>Hello! My name is Marisa Paninski and I am currently majoring in <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong> with a concentration in project management. I am interested in seeing the back end of projects and how they come to be the finished result. I have working knowledge of Microsoft platforms such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Project.</p>
         <br> <p>With my current ongoing internship, I have seen the IT side of a business and how it helps to run the company smoothly. At this internship I was a part of a data reconciliation team that helped find missing parts in our system using <strong>Epicor software</strong> and working with other heads of departments. This project ended Summer 2024 with a result that helped the finance, inventory, and planning departments.</p> 
         <br><p>Outside of school and work I enjoy doing crafts, social media, and hanging out with friends. I am from Syracuse and have continuously enjoyed following along with our sports teams my entire life. I am always looking for opportunities to learn more about different fields within the IT sector!</p>
